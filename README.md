**Transform your Minecraft experience by replacing every single sound with your own voice!**

*"dub" all 2700+ Minecraft sounds to create a truly shitty gaming experience.*

## To anyone who knows textual
if you happen to know textual and especially tcss/css then consider working on some customization for the interface (my previous attempts resulted in total loss of usability

## ✨ Features
- None! this shit sucks ass
- a somewhat comfortable sound browser

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Minecraft installed on your system (if you want to play, otherwise you only need python >= 3.13 but i guess oler versions will work just fine)
- Working microphone
- a shit ton of free time

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fork0n/minecraft-sound-dubbing.git
   cd minecraft-sound-dubbing
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install textual #for "ui"
   pip install pygame #for sound
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   # in the minecraft-sound-dubbing path
   py .\main.py
   ```

## 🎯 How It Works

This application allows you to:

1. **Browse** through Minecraft's extensive sound library (2700+ sounds which YOU want to record with YOUR voice)
2. **Record** your own voice for each sound effect
3. **Preview** your recordings before applying them
4. **Export** your custom sound pack (maybe i'll add an automated zipper)
5. **Drop** your zipped datapack in your .\resourcepacks folder in .minecraft or wherever you have it installed 

### Sound Categories

Minecraft contains thousands of sounds across various categories: (i'm not 100% sure about anything on that list)
- 🐄 **Mob Sounds**: Animal noises, monster growls, villager chatter
- 🎵 **Music**: Background music, disc music
- 🔨 **Block Sounds**: Breaking, placing, stepping sounds
- 🌊 **Ambient**: Weather, water, fire, and environmental sounds
- 🎮 **UI Sounds**: Menu clicks, inventory sounds, notifications
- ⚔️ **Combat**: Weapon sounds, damage effects
- 🏃 **Player Actions**: Footsteps, eating, drinking, and movement ()

**Q: How long does it take to record all sounds?**
A: a lot of your precious time, but imagine if you had to manually record and rename and convert to ogg everything (totally optional btw)

**Q: What audio formats are supported?**
A: Only .ogg because that's what minecraft uses

**Q: Will this work with modded Minecraft?**
A: i don't fucking know, only if the mod creator want's to contribute

**Q: Can I share my voice pack with others?**
A: just drop them your datapack, it's not that deep
